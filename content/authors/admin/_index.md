Brian Jalaian is a senior Artificial Intelligence (AI) research scientist at ARL and a adjunct assistant professor at Virginia Tech. 
He has obtained his Ph.D. from the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2016 at Virginia Tech. He has obtained his MS in Electrical Engineering (Network and Communication Systems)  and MS in Industrial System Engineering (Operation Research) in 2013 and 2014 at Virginia Tech, respectively. He has been serving as a subject matter expert on AI assurance, safety, and security for mission-critical applications. His research interests are the broad area of robust and resilient AI including uncertainty quantification for machine learning, adversarial machine learning, test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEV&V) for deep learning-based intelligent systems. Dr. Jalaian has experience on forming and leading cross-functional machine learning teams to pursue research and development on cutting-edge technologies. His research experience, skills, and technical leadership impact the basic research on developing unique capabilities for artificial intelligence for Army Research Laboratory. Particularly, he formed and led a technical machine learning research team focusing on uncertainty quantification, safe, robust, and resilient artificial intelligence on the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance, which has been very successful and contributed to several knowledge products and highlighted the importance of technological .
