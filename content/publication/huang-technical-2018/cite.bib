 abstract = {Recent advances in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication show that equipping base stations (BSs) with large arrays of antenna can significantly improve the performance of cellular networks. Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) sub-frame configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macro cell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on uplink transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per-user grows infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical simulations.},
