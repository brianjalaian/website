 abstract = {Â© 2017 IEEE. This paper presents a novel 3D delivery system utilizing a UAV. In the example presented within this paper, the system receives a request for delivery via a designed APP from a client and later delivers that item to a desired location in the three dimensional environment. The UAV has the ability to navigate in the outdoor environment and move from the base location to the supplier at the first stage and later find the optimum path to the client for delivery. The system focuses on delivering above ground level locations, such as a specified floor in a building. This system can be used in various realistic scenarios in order to autonomously deliver goods from an arbitrary point to a client in multistory buildings such as an office or home.},
