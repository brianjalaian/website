 abstract = {Given the self-aware, artificially intelligent, and complex system-of-systems nature of the Internet of Things (IoT), un-intended behavior will manifest itself in many forms. In this paper, we illustrate a method for steganographic messaging that can exploit IoT side channels and be resilient to the heterogeneous communications and application protocols that exist in the IoT. We show that IoT side channels are susceptible to network steganography. Moreover, it is possible to create a data-in-motion steganographic method without network protocol modifications and mathematically bound the channel capacity.},
