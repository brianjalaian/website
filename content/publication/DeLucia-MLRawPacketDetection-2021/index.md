abstract: "Increasingly cyber-attacks are sophisticated and occur rapidly, necessitating the use of machine learning techniques for detection at machine speed. However, the use of machine learning techniques in cyber security requires the extraction of features from the raw network traffic. Thus, subject matter expertise is essential to analyze the network traffic and extract optimum features to detect a cyber-attack. Consequently, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm for malicious network traffic detection using only the bytes of the raw network traffic. The feature vector in our machine learning method is a structure containing the headers and a variable number of payload bytes. We propose a 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Feed Forward Network for detection of malicious packets using raw network bytes."
