abstract: "In this paper, a model for processing the a↵ective properties of interaction between human and information is presented. During the interaction process between the human and the information system, various a↵ects could be transferred from human to system and vice versa. Such transitions can be modeled by considering each a↵ect as a combination of basic constitutional values over time. This model can facilitate bridging the gap of human and information during interaction."
